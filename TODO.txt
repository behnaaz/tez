HIGHLIGHT
The contributions of this dissertation are as follows:
 to implement the implement of the 
how it can be encoded in our constraint-based framework, then we extend this solution to numeric prioeirties. Then, we present an evaluation on the performance of our solution through a case study.

\section{Correctness and Compositionality}
\label{sec:proofs}

An experimental study done on the efficiency of using SAT-solvers to generate Reo formal semantics \cite{JoseThesis} compares two prototypes based on constraint satisfaction techniques and connector coloring semantics, without taking data constraints in consideration. The results illustrate that the approach based on constraint solving scales better and????? is more efficient. >

In chapter \ref{ch:prio} we present an evalation through a case study, which affirms this conclusion.

Another inherent limitation of these algorithms stem from that they model data explicitly. As a consequence, in practice the set of input data needs to be limited to a predefined small set. This holds even for connecters with no data-sensitive components, which shows the same behavior for each data item.

In Chapter \cite{ch:prio} (\cite{behconstraint}), we presented the constraints that a primitive imposes on a network as a CSP. Here we extend these constraints with priority capturing variables. 

 In addition, we are planning to extend our constraint-based framework to generate data to be used for simulation and testing purposes.
