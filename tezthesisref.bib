It is proved that for specific dynamic priority relations certain properties (especially liveness and the existence of home states) do hold if and only if these properties do also hold for the Petri net without priorities. We present an algorithm based on these priority relations additionally exploiting T-invariants thus being able to benefit from the structure of the net.},

The framework consists of two levels: uncoloured and coloured. Each level comprises a family of related Petri net classes, sharing structure, but being specialized by their kinetic information. Petri nets of all net classes within one level can be converted into each other, while changing the level involves user-guided folding or automatic unfolding. Models can be hierarchically structured, allowing for the mastering of larger networks. Snoopy supports the simultaneous use of several Petri net classes; the graphical user interface adapts dynamically to the active one. Built-in animation and simulation (depending on the net class) are complemented by export to various analysis tools. Snoopy facilitates the extension by new Petri net classes thanks to its generic design.",

By focusing on this subset we achieve a simple graph model that highlights the particular non-local features of the inclusive gateway semantics. We sketch two ways of implementing the semantics using algorithms based on incrementally updated data structures and also discuss distributed communication-based implementations of the two algorithms.",

	abstract = "Under the umbrella of buzzwords such as “Business Activity Monitoring” (BAM) and “Business Process Intelligence” (BPI) both academic (e.g., EMiT, Little Thumb, InWoLvE, Process Miner, and MinSoN) and commercial tools (e.g., ARIS PPM, HP BPI, and ILOG JViews) have been developed. The goal of these tools is to extract knowledge from event logs (e.g., transaction logs in an ERP system or audit trails in a WFM system), i.e., to do process mining. Unfortunately, tools use different formats for reading/storing log files and present their results in different ways. This makes it difficult to use different tools on the same data set and to compare the mining results. Furthermore, some of these tools implement concepts that can be very useful in the other tools but it is often difficult to combine tools. As a result, researchers working on new process mining techniques are forced to build a mining infrastructure from scratch or test their techniques in an isolated way, disconnected from any practical applications. To overcome these kind of problems, we have developed the ProM framework, i.e., an “pluggable” environment for process mining. The framework is flexible with respect to the input and output format, and is also open enough to allow for the easy reuse of code during the implementation of new process mining ideas. This paper introduces the ProM framework and gives an overview of the plug-ins that have been developed.",

	abstract = { Business Process Model and Notation is known as a widely used standard for business processes modeling. However, its main drawback is that it lacks formal semantics, leading to some undesirable properties, such as livelocks and deadlocks, such that it creates models with semantic errors. In order to formally verify them, we need to transform it onto a formal language, for example, Petri nets. The approach proposed in this article is an extension of previous approaches stated in the literature by adding probability to gateways and time to transitions. The first aim is to transform the Business Process Model and Notation process diagram onto Petri nets automatically using a developed software package. The developed software package is capable of transforming the XML file of a Business Process Model and Notation process diagram into “m” files of a Petri net. The “m” files of the Petri net are then coupled with the General Purpose Petri Net Simulator (GPenSIM) for analysis in MATLAB. The second aim is to manually transform the Business Process Model and Notation process diagram using mapping figures onto Petri nets and then analyze it using Timed Petri Net Analyzer tools. The advantage of transforming a Business Process Model and Notation diagram automatically is that we can add time to transitions and probability to gateways. Furthermore, the simulation time can be checked using MATLAB. },

Connectors are constructed from primitive channels and can be reconfigured dynamically. Reconfigurations can even execute within a pending I/O transaction. In this article, we formally model and analyze dynamic reconfigurations and show how running coordinators can be reconfigured without the cooperation of their engaged components. We utilize the theory of high-level replacement systems to model rule-based reconfigurations of connectors. This allows us to perform a complex reconfiguration as an atomic step and analyze it using formal verification techniques. Specifically, we formalize the structure of connectors as typed hypergraphs and use critical pair and state space analyses for verification of dynamic reconfigurations. We provide a full implementation of our approach in a framework that includes tools for the definition, analysis, and execution of reconfigurations, and is integrated with two execution engines for Reo. Our framework, moreover, integrates with the graph transformation tools \{AGG\} and \{GROOVE\} for formal analysis, as well as the Eclipse platform and standard web service technologies. "

  abstract = {The concept of "model" is today considered as a promising technology in domains such as data and software engineering. In the field of model engineering, models are now viewed as firts-class entities. This new approach makes it possible to envision the integration of models into engineering processes. Such an integration will however require a set of dedicated tools enabling to perform standard model operations onto handled models. We strongly believe that, in order to achieve usability for large communinities of users, model-based tools have to rely on a common and well-defined theorical modeling framework.

This report addresses both theorical and implementation issues. We propose the idea that a common set of principles may be mapped to different implementation contexts. We illustrate our approach with AMMA, our current proposal for a model-based conceptual architecture.

	Abstract = {The Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) is a graph-oriented language in
which control and action nodes can be connected almost arbitrarily. It is primarily targeted at domain analysts and is supported by many modelling tools, but in its current form, it lacks the semantic precision required to capture fully executable business processes. The Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL) on the other hand is a mainly block-structured language, targeted at software developers and supported by several execution platforms. In the current setting, translating BPMN models into BPEL code is a necessary step towards standards-based business process development environments. This translation is challenging since BPMN and BPEL represent two fundamentally different classes of languages. Existing BPMN-to-BPEL translations rely on the identification of block-structured patterns in BPMN models that are mapped into block-structured BPEL constructs. This paper advances the state of the art in BPMN-to-BPEL translation by defining methods for identifying not only perfectly block-structured fragments in BPMN models, but also quasi-structured fragments that can be
turned into perfectly structured ones and flow-based acyclic fragments that can be mapped into a combination of block-structured constructs and control links. Beyond its direct relevance in the context of BPMN and BPEL, this paper addresses issues that arise generally when translating between graph-oriented and block-structured flow definition languages.},

	Abstract = {Reo is an exogenous coordination language based on a calculus of channel composition. Different formal models have been developed for this language. In this paper, we present a new approach to modeling and analysis of Reo connectors using Alloy which is a lightweight modeling language based on first-order relational logic. We provide a reusable library of Reo channels in Alloy that can be used to create a model of a Reo connector in Alloy. The model is simple and reflects the original structure of the connector. Furthermore, the model of a connector can be reused as a component for constructing more complex connectors. Using the Alloy Analyzer tool, properties expressed as predicates can be verified by automatically analyzing the execution traces of the Reo connector. We handle the context-sensitive behavior of channels as well as optional constraints on the interactions with environment. Our compositional model can be used as an alternative to other existing approaches, and is supported by a well known tool with a rich set of features such as counterexample generation.},

	which offers a channel-based framework to compose complex component
	connectors. In this paper, we introduce a variant of constraint automata
	with discrete probabilities and nondeterminism, called probabilistic
	constraint automata. These can serve for compositional reasoning
	about connector components, modelled by Reo circuits with unreliable
	channels, e.g., that might lose or corrupt messages, or channels
	with random output values that, e.g., can be helpful to model randomized
	coordination principles.},

@article{yices,
	Abstract = {{SMT stands for Satis��?ability ModuloTheories. An SMT solver decides
	the satis��?ability of propositionally complex formulas in theories
	such as arithmetic and uninterpreted functions with equality. SMT
	solving has numerous applications in automated theorem proving, in
	hardware and software veri��?cation, and in scheduling and planning
	problems. This paper describes Yices, an ef��?cient SMT solver developed
	at SRIInternational. Yices supports a rich combination of ��?rst-order
	theories that occur frequently in software and hardware modeling:
	arithmetic, uninterpreted functions, bit vectors, arrays, recursive
	datatypes, and more. Beyond pure SMT solving, Yices can solve weighted
	MAX-SMT problems, compute unsatis��?able cores, and construct models.
	Yices is the main decision procedure used by the SAL model checking
	environment, and it is be- ing integrated to the PVS theorem prover.
	As a MAX-SMT solver, Yices is the main component of the probabilistic
	consistency engine used in SRI's CALO system.}},

@inproceedings{torx,
	Abstract = {Systematic testing is very important for assessing and improving the quality of software systems. Yet, testing turns out to be expensive, laborious, time-consuming and error-prone. The Dutch research and development project C{\^o}te de Resyste worked on methods, techniques and tools for automating specification based testing using formal methods. The main achievement of the project is a test tool, baptized TorX, which integrates automatic test generation, test execution, and test analysis in an on-the-fly manner. On the one hand, TorX is based on well-defined theory, viz. the ioco-test theory, which has its roots in the theory of testing- and refusal-equivalences for transition systems. On the other hand, the applicability of TorX has been demonstrated by testing several academic and industrial case studies. This paper summarizes the main results of the project C{\^o}te de Resyste.},

abstract="Model checking, as one area of formal verification, is recently subject of an intensive research. Many verification tools intended to check properties of models of systems were developed, mainly at universities. Many researches are also interested in real-time database management systems (RTDBMS). In this paper we show some possibilities of using a verification tool Uppaal on some variants of priority assignment algorithms used in RTDBMS. We present some possible models of such algorithms expressed as nets of timed automata, which are a modeling language of Uppaal and then some simulation and verification possibilities of Uppaal on those models.",
